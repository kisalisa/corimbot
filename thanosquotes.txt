You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me.
I am inevitable.
You should have gone for the head.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Today I have lost more than you could ever know.
This day extracts a heavy toll.
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
