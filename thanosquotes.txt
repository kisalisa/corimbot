You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me.
I am inevitable.
You should have gone for the head.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Today I have lost more than you could ever know.
This day extracts a heavy toll.
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.
I ignored my destiny once, I can not do that again.
I’m sorry Little one.
Did you do it? Yes. What did it cost? Everything.
I never taught you to lie. That’s why you’re so bad at it.
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
The Tesseract… or your brother’s head. I assume you have a preference?
I'm a survivor.
The end is near.
Reality can be whatever I want.
You should choose your words wisely.
No resurrections this time.
I don't even know who you are.
I used the Stones to destroy the Stones. It nearly killed me, but the work is done. It always will be.
A small price to pay for salvation.
Gone, reduced to atoms.
Impossible.
